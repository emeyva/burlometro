I want to create a website where users can upload a photo (should then be parsed with a free OCR library) or a text from their messages, and an AI (from openrouter like deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) can tell if the message is a scam or no.
Make it minimalist and modern like the iphone message interface.
Make it responsive for computer and mobile.
